						<div class="convertlinks documentation" style="white-space:pre-wrap">Message Transmission Optimization Mechanism (MTOM) is a method for efficiently sending large binary attachments, such as images, videos, or files, within a SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) message over the internet. SOAP is an XML-based messaging protocol used for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services in computer networks.

In a typical SOAP message, binary data is encoded using Base64 encoding, which increases the size of the message by approximately 33%. This can lead to performance issues and increased network bandwidth usage, especially when dealing with large binary attachments.

MTOM addresses this problem by optimizing the transmission of binary data in SOAP messages. Instead of embedding the binary data directly within the XML message using Base64 encoding, MTOM uses XOP (XML-binary Optimized Packaging) to package the binary data separately from the XML message. The binary data is sent as-is, without Base64 encoding, alongside the XML message as a MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) attachment.

This approach reduces the overall message size and improves the efficiency of transmitting binary data in SOAP messages. The recipient can still process the XML message and access the binary attachment seamlessly, without any significant changes to the web service implementation.

In summary, MTOM is an optimization mechanism for transmitting large binary attachments within SOAP messages. It reduces message size and network bandwidth usage by sending binary data as MIME attachments rather than embedding them in the XML message using Base64 encoding.

MTOM (Message Transmission Optimization Mechanism) itself does not impose specific size limits on binary attachments. However, the size limits for MTOM attachments may be influenced by various factors, including the web service implementation, the application server, and the network infrastructure. Some common factors that may impact the size limits for MTOM attachments are:

Web service and application server configurations: Different web service frameworks and application servers may have their own default settings or configurable limits on the size of SOAP messages, including MTOM attachments. These limits can usually be adjusted in the server or framework configuration files.

Network constraints: Network infrastructure, including routers, switches, and firewalls, may impose limits on the size of data packets that can be transmitted. This could affect the maximum size of MTOM attachments that can be sent without encountering network-related issues.

Client and server resources: The resources available on the client and server, such as memory and processing power, can impact the handling of large MTOM attachments. Insufficient resources may lead to performance issues or failures when processing large attachments.

Intermediary systems: In some cases, SOAP messages with MTOM attachments may pass through intermediary systems, such as proxy servers, which could impose their own size limits on message attachments.

The size limits for MTOM attachments may vary depending on the specific environment and configuration. It is essential to review the relevant documentation for the web service framework, application server, and network infrastructure to determine any size limitations and configure them appropriately to support the desired attachment sizes.</div>
