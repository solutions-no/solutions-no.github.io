						<div class="convertlinks documentation" style="white-space:pre-wrap">Aspera is a high-speed file transfer protocol and software suite that is designed to move large files and data sets over the internet or private networks at maximum speed, regardless of file size, transfer distance, or network conditions. Aspera is known for its speed, security, and reliability, and is used by many large media and entertainment companies, research institutions, and other organizations that need to move large amounts of data quickly and efficiently.

Aspera is based on a patented technology called FASP (Fast, Adaptive, Secure Protocol) that uses advanced encryption, compression, and data transport techniques to optimize transfer speeds and minimize latency. FASP is designed to achieve the highest possible transfer speeds over any network, including public internet connections, while maintaining the security and integrity of the transferred data.

Aspera software is available in several different versions, including:

Aspera Enterprise Server: A software package that enables high-speed file transfer over WANs (Wide Area Networks) and LANs (Local Area Networks) using the FASP protocol.

Aspera Connect: A client-side software package that enables users to initiate and manage file transfers using the FASP protocol from a web browser or desktop application.

Aspera Shares: A web-based platform that allows users to securely share large files and data sets with external partners or customers using the FASP protocol.

Aspera Console: A web-based management and monitoring platform that enables administrators to manage and monitor Aspera transfers across the enterprise.

Aspera is known for its high performance, reliability, and security, and is used by many organizations that need to move large amounts of data quickly and efficiently. However, Aspera can be more expensive than other file transfer solutions, and may not be necessary for all use cases.</div>
