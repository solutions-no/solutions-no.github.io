* FTP (File Transfer Protocol): FTP is one of the oldest and most widely used file transfer protocols. It allows users to transfer files between servers and clients over a network. FTP is a reliable protocol for transferring large files, but it lacks some of the security features of more modern protocols.

* SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol): SFTP is an extension of FTP that adds encryption and other security features. It uses SSH (Secure Shell) to establish a secure connection between the server and client, and allows users to transfer files securely over a network.

* HTTP/S (Hypertext Transfer Protocol/Secure): HTTP/S is the protocol used for transferring data over the World Wide Web. It allows users to transfer files between servers and clients using a web browser or other web-based tools. While HTTP/S is not specifically designed for large file transfers, it can be used to transfer files of any size.

* Aspera: Aspera is a high-speed file transfer protocol that is designed specifically for transferring very large files over a network. It uses advanced encryption and compression techniques to optimize transfer speeds, and is used by many media and entertainment companies for transferring large video and audio files.

* BitTorrent: BitTorrent is a peer-to-peer file sharing protocol that allows users to transfer large files between computers in a decentralized manner. It is often used for sharing large files such as movies or software packages, and can be a fast and efficient way to transfer very large files.

These are just a few examples of file transfer protocols that can be used for sharing very large files. The specific protocol you choose will depend on your needs and the requirements of your particular use case.</div>
