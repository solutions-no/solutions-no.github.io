Syn. eTS Creation Service

INTEROPERABILITY SALIENCY:
The e-Timestamp Creation Service ABB &#160;is salient for technical interoperability because it provides 
the functionalities required for e-Timestamp creation service.

EXAMPLES:
The following implementation is an example on how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB):
DigiStamp eTimeStamp&#174;
DigiStamp eTimeStamp&#174; protects the intellectual property in any computer file:
&#8226;	Use Desktop and Web applications for on-demand protection
&#8226;	Plug the Timestamp Authority into the automated systems
Plug-in rigorous implementation of US &amp; EU standards:
&#8226;	Secure, reliable, RFC 3161 timestamp cloud service
&#8226;	Archiving and Hash Chaining keyless security
&#8226;	Elliptic Curve Upgrade
Implementation of the Internet Engineering Task Force's RFC 3161 means DigiStamp timestamps are understood by data validation systems the world over:
&#8226;	Implementation of ANSI X9.95 further increases the compatibility of our timestamps.
&#8226;	Compliance with IETF RFC 3628 gives credence to the trustworthiness of our Time Stamp Authorities.
&#8226;	Conformance to IETF RFC 3126 makes our timestamps usable for long-term, legally binding agreements.

freeTSA.org offers free NTP and DNSCRYPT services
freeTSA.org provides a free Time Stamp Authority. Adding a trusted timestamp to code or to an electronic signature provides a digital seal of data integrity and a trusted date and time of when the transaction took place.
Trusted timestamping is the process of securely keeping track of the creation and modification times of a document. Security here means that no one - not even the owner of the document - should be able to change it once it has been recorded provided that the timestamper's integrity is never compromised. FreeTSA trusted timestamping Software as a Service (SaaS) provides an easy method to apply RFC 3161 trusted timestamps to time-sensitive transactions through independently verified and auditable date and UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) sources.
